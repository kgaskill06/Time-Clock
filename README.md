# Time-Clock

This project started us with the first part of critical thinking when it comes to decision making. 
You have to think how to logically convert the time from military to standard. A tricky step was factoring in AM PM. 

I find the use of if/else rather easy for me to comprehrend. Problem solving with them was easy and I was able to create a code that converts the time while taking into account
am and pm. 

At this given time, I do not know what else I could of done to improve the code. It all seem srather well executed, I am sure once I learn more and master C++ 
I could easily identify what I may have been missing. I suppose I could put the methods into classes to help clean up the code in the main src file.

The part I found most challenging was how to use the time library. I had to do some reading in proper fomarting for the code from popular cplusplus sites.

Switch statements with string formating will be valuable skills to carry forth as these have heavy uses in interfaces and menu systems.

I made this program maintainable by writing my codes with proper notes indicating each function and their purpose. Having readible code helps with understanding the purpose
and maintability. This code is adaptable because it is clearly labeled and if someone wanted to improve it, they would know where to make their adjustments.
